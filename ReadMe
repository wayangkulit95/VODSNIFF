Instructions to Run the Script
Install Required Libraries: Ensure you have Node.js installed, and then install the necessary libraries if you haven’t done so yet:

bash
Copy code
npm install axios cheerio fs
Update the Script:

Replace https://example.com/login with the actual login URL.
Replace https://example.com/protected-page with the URL of the page you want to scrape after logging in.
Update the username and password fields in the credentials object with your actual login credentials.
Run the Script: Save the script to a file, e.g., collectVideos.js, and run it with:

bash
Copy code
node collectVideos.js
Output: After executing, the script will create a videoLinks.json file in the same directory, containing all collected video URLs.

Notes
Ensure that you have the legal right to scrape the website and that it doesn’t violate the website's terms of service.
The way the login works may vary based on the website (e.g., it might require additional headers or parameters). Adjust the login request accordingly if you encounter issues.
